First step i created a folder mkdir using git bash. then added index.html, 
home.html, script.js and style.css after that i opened the atom applicaton 
to add codes into the files. then after that i commit each file.

The second step i created a branch named featured-navbar and to modify the home.html adding a navbar so i go back to the atom application
and modified the home.html added navbar and saved it and i go back to the git to
commit then i checkout master to see if the code changes when im changing branch
after that it works then now i go back to the master and do the merge

Third step i created a repository in github and remote the link and i go back to the git
and push it through the github repostiory and everything seem working.
